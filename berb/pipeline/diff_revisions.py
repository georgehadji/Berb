"""Diff-based code revisions for token efficiency.

This module implements diff-based code generation - generating patches
instead of full file rewrites, achieving 60-80% token reduction on
revisions and eliminating "forgot existing code" errors.

Architecture: Patch generation with validation
Paradigm: Unified diff format with smart application

Usage:
    from researchclaw.pipeline.diff_revisions import DiffBasedReviser
    
    reviser = DiffBasedReviser(base_client=llm_client)
    
    result = await reviser.revise(
        original_code=existing_code,
        critique="Add error handling for empty input",
        file_path="module.py",
    )
    
    # Returns patched code with diff
    print(result.diff)  # Unified diff
    print(result.patched_code)  # Full patched code
