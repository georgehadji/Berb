## Specific Use Cases

### Perplexity Sonar Integration

#### Stage 3-4: Literature Search Enhancement

**Current:** OpenAlex + Semantic Scholar + arXiv APIs

**With Sonar Deep Research:**
```python
# researchclaw/literature/perplexity_client.py

class PerplexityClient:
    async def deep_research(self, topic: str) -> LiteratureReview:
        """Use sonar-deep-research for comprehensive literature review."""
        response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="sonar-deep-research",
            messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""Conduct comprehensive literature review on: {topic}
                
                Include:
                1. Key papers (with DOI, authors, venue, year)
                2. Main findings from each paper
                3. Research gaps identified
                4. Conflicting results
                5. Recent developments (last 2 years)
                
                Output as structured JSON with citations."""
            }]
        )
        return self._parse_literature_review(response)
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- **+40-60%** more papers found (includes non-indexed preprints, blog posts, industry reports)
- **Real-time** information (not limited by API update cycles)
- **Synthesized** findings (not just paper list)
- **Cross-source** verification

**Cost Comparison:**
| Method | Cost per Search | Coverage | Freshness |
|--------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| OpenAlex API | Free | 200M+ papers | Weekly updates |
| Semantic Scholar | Free | 200M+ papers | Weekly updates |
| arXiv API | Free | 2M+ preprints | Daily updates |
| **Sonar Deep Research** | **~$0.50-2.00** | **Web-scale** | **Real-time** |

**Recommendation:** Use Sonar Deep Research as **supplement** to existing APIs for comprehensive coverage.

---

#### Stage 23: Citation Verification Enhancement

**Current:** 4-layer verification (arXiv, CrossRef, DataCite, LLM)

**With Sonar:**
```python
async def verify_citation_sonar(self, citation: Citation) -> VerificationResult:
    """Use sonar-pro for real-time citation verification."""
    response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sonar-pro",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""Verify this citation exists and is accurately represented:
            
            Citation: {citation.bibtex}
            Claimed finding: {citation.claimed_finding}
            
            Search web for:
            1. Paper existence (title, authors, venue)
            2. Actual findings (compare with claimed)
            3. Citation count
            4. Any retractions or corrections
            
            Output: VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED/INACCURATE with evidence."""
        }]
    )
    return self._parse_verification(response)
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Real-time verification** (not limited by API coverage)
- **Retraction detection** (papers withdrawn after initial indexing)
- **Finding accuracy** (verify claims match actual paper content)

---

### xAI Grok Integration

#### Stage 4: Full-Paper Analysis with 2M Context

**Current:** Analyze papers via abstracts + excerpts (limited by context window)

**With Grok 4.20 (2M tokens):**
```python
# researchclaw/literature/grok_client.py

class GrokClient:
    async def analyze_full_paper(self, paper_pdf_text: str) -> PaperAnalysis:
        """Analyze entire paper in single context (2M tokens = ~1,500 pages)."""
        response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="grok-4.20",
            messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""Analyze this complete research paper:
                
                {paper_pdf_text[:2_000_000]}  # Full paper text
                
                Extract:
                1. Research question
                2. Methodology
                3. Key findings (with statistics)
                4. Limitations
                5. Future work
                6. Code/data availability
                7. Reproducibility score (1-10)
                
                Output as structured JSON."""
            }]
        )
        return self._parse_paper_analysis(response)
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Complete analysis** (not just abstract)
- **Methodology extraction** (full details from methods section)
- **Limitation identification** (often in discussion, not abstract)
- **Reproducibility assessment** (check code/data availability)

**Cost Comparison:**
| Model | Context | Cost per Paper | Analysis Quality |
|-------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| GPT-4o | 128K | ~$0.50 | Partial (abstract + excerpts) |
| Claude Sonnet | 200K | ~$0.60 | Partial (most sections) |
| **Grok 4.20** | **2M** | **~$4.00** | **Complete (full paper)** |

**Recommendation:** Use Grok 4.20 for **key papers** (top 10-20 most relevant), standard models for others.

---

#### Stage 8: Hypothesis Generation with Cross-Paper Synthesis

**Current:** Generate hypotheses from knowledge cards (summarized findings)

**With Grok 4.20:**
```python
async def generate_hypotheses_synthesis(self, papers: list[FullPaper]) -> list[Hypothesis]:
    """Synthesize hypotheses from 50+ full papers simultaneously."""
    # Load 50 full papers into context (50 × 30K tokens = 1.5M tokens)
    all_papers_text = "\n\n=== PAPER ===\n\n".join(
        [p.full_text for p in papers[:50]]
    )
    
    response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model="grok-4.20",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""Based on these {len(papers)} research papers, generate novel hypotheses:
            
            {all_papers_text[:2_000_000]}
            
            Identify:
            1. Patterns across papers
            2. Contradictions to resolve
            3. Unexplored combinations
            4. Methodology gaps
            5. Promising directions
            
            Generate 5-10 testable hypotheses with rationale."""
        }]
    )
    return self._parse_hypotheses(response)
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Cross-paper patterns** (see connections across 50+ papers)
- **Contradiction resolution** (identify conflicting findings)
- **Novel combinations** (synthesize ideas from different papers)
- **Higher quality hypotheses** (based on complete information)

---

#### Stage 16-17: Full Paper Draft Generation

**Current:** Generate paper draft section-by-section (limited context)

**With Grok 4.20:**
```python
async def generate_full_draft(self, all_content: dict) -> FullPaperDraft:
    """Generate complete paper draft in single context."""
    response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model="grok-4.20",
        messages=[{
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an academic writer. Generate a complete NeurIPS-format research paper."
        }, {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""Generate complete research paper with:
            
            Topic: {all_content['topic']}
            Hypothesis: {all_content['hypothesis']}
            Experiments: {all_content['experiments']}
            Results: {all_content['results']}
            Related Work: {all_content['related_work']}
            
            Generate:
            1. Title
            2. Abstract (150-200 words)
            3. Introduction
            4. Related Work (synthesize {len(all_content['papers'])} papers)
            5. Method
            6. Experiments
            7. Results
            8. Discussion
            9. Conclusion
            10. References
            
            Full paper, 6,000-8,000 words, NeurIPS format."""
        }]
    )
    return self._parse_draft(response)
```

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Coherent narrative** (single generation, not pieced together)
- **Consistent terminology** (no section-to-section drift)
- **Better flow** (model sees entire paper structure)
- **Faster generation** (single API call vs 10+ for sections)
